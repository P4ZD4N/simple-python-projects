# DESCRIPTION

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to
<br>
create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
<br><br>
Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
<br><br>
[] --> "no one likes this"
<br>
["Peter"] --> "Peter likes this"
<br>
["Jacob", "Alex"] --> "Jacob and Alex like this"
<br>
["Max", "John", "Mark"] --> "Max, John and Mark like this"
<br>
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] --> "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
<br><br>
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.
